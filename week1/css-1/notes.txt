CSS Positioning

Position property
.whatever{
	position : <vlues>;
}

Static - All elements have static positioning by default
		 Considered to NOT be positioned

Relative - Positioned relative to where they WOULD be
		   as a statically positioned element
		   Still take up space where they wouldbe  statically positioned

Absolute - Positions the element relative to its closest
		   positioned ancestor (or the body)
		   DO NOT take up space - they're removed from the document flow

Fixed - Positions element relative to the WINDOW


CSS Specificity
All selectors have specificity in CSS
HIGHER specificity trumps LOWER specificity

Display Types

Block - (div, p, article, sections)
		Full page width - do NOT share space on a line
		Can HAVE dimensions

Inline - (span, anchor, img, strong)
		 Smaller, wrap their content - WILL share space on a line
		 Can NOT have dimensions

Inline-Block - (No default inline-block elements)
				Sizeable like block level elements
				WILL share space on a line
				Can HAVE dimensions


Floats Notes

Floating an element removes it from the document flow (mostly)
But allows text to wrap around it

Clearing an element prevents it from sharing space on a line with floated elements

Overflow
Dictates how content that would normally overflow a container is displayed (auto, scroll, hidden, visible)

When an element is floated and the other wrapping element has overflow:hidden, it creates a Block Formatting Context
